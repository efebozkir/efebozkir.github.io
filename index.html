				I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a>, <a href="https://www.edu.sot.tum.de/en/hctl/team/postdoctoral-researchers/dr-efe-bozkir/">Chair of Human-Centered Technologies for Learning</a> and Friedrich Schiedel Fellow for Technology in Society at <a href="https://tumthinktank.de/en/news/meet-the-first-cohort-of-friedrich-schiedel-fellows/">TUM Think Tank</a>. I work on human-computer interaction, extended reality, and privacy, broadly defined.
              </p>
              <p>
                Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/">University of T√ºbingen</a>, Department of Computer Science, where I worked on extended reality, eye tracking, and privacy. I was also a visiting postdoctoral researcher between August 2022 and January 2023 at <a href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/">CyLab Security and Privacy Institute</a> of <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I conducted research on usable privacy and security with <a href="https://lorrie.cranor.org/">Lorrie Cranor</a> and <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~lbauer/">Lujo Bauer</a> and I was supported by <a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/">Cluster of Excellence ‚Äì Machine Learning for Science</a>.
				I got my doctoral degree in 2022 from the <a href="https://www.hci.uni-tuebingen.de/">Human-Computer Interaction Lab</a> of the <a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/">University of T√ºbingen</a>, where <a href="https://www.edu.sot.tum.de/en/hctl/prof-dr-enkelejda-kasneci/">Enkelejda Kasneci</a> advised me. My <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15703">dissertation</a> revolved around virtual reality, eye tracking, and information privacy. 
				Before those, I got my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees from the <a href="https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/cs/home/">Department of Computer Science</a> of <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">TUM</a> and the <a href="https://bbf.itu.edu.tr/en/">Department of Computer Engineering</a> of <a href="https://itu.edu.tr/en">Istanbul Technical University</a> in 2016 and 2014, respectively. 
              </p>
			  <p>
                I have some industry experience as well, where I worked at various places such as <a href="https://www.netlight.com/">Netlight Consulting</a> in Munich and Hamburg as an IT consultant and at <a href="https://www.ti.com/">Texas Instruments</a> in Freising as a software developer. 
				My focus in the industry was backend development, natural language understanding, and conversational UI.

				My research revolves around <b>human-computer interaction</b> and <b>artificial intelligence</b> in <b>extended reality</b> by involving different sensing modalities such as <b>eye tracking</b> to understand how humans behave and the <b>privacy</b> implications of such settings, focusing both on computational techniques and human factors. 
				My aim is to make virtual and immersive setups more user-centered, intuitive, and usable so that these setups can be adopted by wider communities in everyday life. 
				As very fine-grained information can be obtained about humans in these setups due to the nature of the devices and settings, I think that privacy aspects should be taken into account very carefully so that all those fascinating opportunities are not overshadowed by privacy concerns. 
              </p>
			  <p>
				I am always interested in new academic and industry collaborations and think that interdisciplinary work is key for groundbreaking research and development. 
				If you are interested in what I do, both potentially as a collaborator or as a student, feel free to reach out. I am happy to discuss this as long as we can find a mutual interest. 
              </p>

				Apart from professional research and development activities, I am interested in new technologies, enjoy cycling and playing basketball, and am an avid backpacker.
